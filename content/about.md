Hi everyone 😃 ! I am Aldo Fuster Turpin.

I am a Software Engineer graduated at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC, BarcelonaTech), Barcelona, Spain.

I am currently working as a Cloud Platform Engineer at IBM in Spain. Right now I am focused in the design and development of Cloud Native applications using Go, Typescript, Java, Python, docker, k8s, OpenShift & IBM Cloud.

I really care about code quality, so I always follow clean code philosophy, SOLID principles and TDD. I am also interested in Clean Architecture, Software Design and everything related to the Cloud.

Within IBM, I have been lucky enough to conduct two internal talks about SOLID Principles and Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) for the engineering team. I have also participated in the IBM Developers Europe festival to talk about CI/CD, OpenShift & the work we do at the IBM Client Engineering team.

Hope you find my blog interesting and see you soon!

Cheers,
Aldo.
